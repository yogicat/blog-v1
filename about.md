Hi, I am Dahe Oh from [Seoul](https://goo.gl/maps/XHPqFJ4B4Dy). I am designer turned into a developer. Taking notes is one of my great passion. This site is more like a personal archive of my daily thoughts and notes. Sometimes(or most of the time) I write in Korean so bear in mind!

I built this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github](https://githu.io). I try to keep this site super simple as possible.
