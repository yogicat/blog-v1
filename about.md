Hi, I am Ohda from [Seoul](https://goo.gl/maps/XHPqFJ4B4Dy). I am self-taught front-end-developer with a design background.

Recently, I am interested in `humane design & technologies`. I believe that services that we use in everyday life can be meaningful and beautiful at the same time.

On my free time, I indulge myself in various podcasts, books, and outdoor activities.

You can find me on [instagram](https://instagram.com/ohdayoda), [github](https://github.com/yogicat), or [linkedin](https://linkedin.com). If you want to say hi, feel free to contact me via email <hi@ohda.fun>.
