Today I read Just Kids and found out this cool list.

***

Since last night I started to read \[Just Kids\]([https://amzn.to/2A1R9He](https://amzn.to/2A1R9He "https://amzn.to/2A1R9He")) written by Patti Smith. I didn't know who she was until today. I heard \[Seth Godin\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin")) highly recommended this book from some podcast episode. It was on my kindle for a while and finally able to read thanks to the sleepless night.

I found myself deeply engaged with her childhood story as if I were with her all along. I love her way of expressing her feelings, how she explains the atmosphere, nature and even tiny little details.

It has been a while since I met such a book that couldn't wait to read more.
