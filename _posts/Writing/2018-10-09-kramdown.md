Jekyll uses [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) as their markdown engine.
I thought it's just another markdown stuff but it's actually much more powerful than I thought.

Just like typescript is a superset of javascript, kramdown is a superset of markdown.

To me most useful and amazing feature was Block Attriutes.

{% highlight html %}
  {: .class #custom-id}
  paragraph...
{% endhighlight %}

You can also do inline attributes,

{% highlight html %}
This is *red*{: style="color: red"}.
{% endhighlight %}
