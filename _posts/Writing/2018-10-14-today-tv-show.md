Today I watched [Mudbound](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mudbound) on Netflix. I felt sad and mad. I didn't want to watch it because I knew it would make me upset just like the podcast-Serial did. I think we all need to watch it despite how painful it is afterwards. What does it mean to be a human? After reading Sapiens by Uval Harari, a perception of the whole world around me shifted from known to unknown.
What are we to say we are better than any creature?

One might argue that we had enough of those kinds of films, books and podcasts. But there are more stories and souls to be heard. Through those great medium we get to expands out point of view.

So mad about 'Pappy' from the movie, I don't know how I can watch 'better call Saul' again.
